# smart-join-lines README

## Features

`smartJoinLines.join` (on command pallet: `smart-join-lines: join` )

- Almost same behavior with built-in `editor.action.joinLines` command.
- For non-space-separated natural language such as Japanese, if the end of line is non-ASCII character, join to the next line without space.
- If hyphenated (_i.e._, the end of the line is `-` ), remove the hyphen and join to the next line.

**Enjoy!**
